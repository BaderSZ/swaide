README

Bash script wrapper for AIDE IDS, made to automate/simplify tasks.

This is by no means complete and as of now not recommended for actual use, as this code is not fully tested and written hurriedly.

TODO:
- interactivity
- lock file compatibilty
- echo progress
- proper user/permission checks
- other functionality
- actually test this thing...
